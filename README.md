Shark Battle is a thrilling multiplayer action-adventure game built with Unity Engine and powered by Photon Multiplayer. Dive deep into an intense underwater battlefield where three players compete for survival, skill, and glory.

Level 1 – The Shark Arena
Three players are dropped into the depths of the ocean, each armed with spears. Their mission: eliminate as many sharks as possible within a 2-minute time limit—all while avoiding deadly attacks from these ferocious sea creatures.
At the end of the countdown, the player with the fewest shark kills is eliminated, while the remaining two progress to the next stage.

Level 2 – The Maze of Shadows
  -The surviving duo enters a twisting underwater maze filled with danger and mystery. Their goal:

  -Find the hidden treasure,

  -Defeat enemies lurking in the maze, and

  -Escape before time runs out.

Once the treasure is claimed, a 2-minute escape timer begins. Both players must find their way out before the timer hits zero—or face elimination.

With fast-paced gameplay, strategic combat, and time-based challenges, Shark Battle delivers a unique and intense multiplayer experience beneath the waves. Do you have what it takes to survive the deep and claim victory?
